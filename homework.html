        <h1>Assalamu walaikum </h1>
        
        <p>Nayem vaiya, I'm a student of your youtube git tutorial class... I can understand any topic very hardly... Thats why I faced many problem from starting video... And I also couldn't open a github account... But now  I have a github account... I couldn't understand fork + pull request... But now those problems are also solved... </p>
        
        
        <h6><mark>But now the biggest problem is finding a repository to fork & pull... So I thought this is the best Idea to resolve it... And you can also advise me for any mistake...</mark></h6>
